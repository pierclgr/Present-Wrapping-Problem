# Requirements
This program converts ".txt" instances to ".dzn" instances for independent testing on MiniZinc. There is no need to install other python packages different that the default. You only need Python 3.8.

# Usage
Move to this *"utils"* folder of the program using the CMD/Terminal command
```bash
cd \path\to\utils\folder\
```
Then, with Python installed, run the command
```bash
python txt_to_dzn.py <file/folder>
```
specifying the file to convert or the folder containing the input instances to convert.
